# Auto Bingo Commands

Bingo Reloaded v1.5.0 adds a set of commands that can be used from the console or by a `bingo.admin` player in-game. The
purpose of these commands, as the name suggests, is to remove the middle man and automate bingo games more for server
owners that want this plugin to work on its own.

With Bingo Reloaded 2.0.0 these commands have to be used on a specific world as this update makes multiworld bingo
possible.

All commands are tab completable. See the list of commands below for a full list.

Just like the /bingo menu settings, these commands apply to any future games of bingo until the server restarts or the
option is overwritten by a new command.
